# aiDocs

A **documentation template** optimized for AI-assisted development. This structure helps teams work effectively with AI coding assistants like Claude, Copilot, and ChatGPT.

## Features

- **LLM-Friendly:** Structured for AI coding assistants with dedicated behavioral instructions
- **Feature-First:** Organized by what software does, not how code is structured
- **AI-Documented:** Designed for human + LLM collaboration
- **Portable:** Copy the entire `docs/` folder to any project for instant consistency

## Quick Start

1. Copy the `docs/` folder to your project
2. Update project-specific files (architecture.md, installation.md, usage.md)
3. Keep template/meta files as-is (README.md, AGENTS.md, CODING_GUIDELINES.md)
4. Add your features to `docs/features/` and fundamentals to `docs/fundamentals/`

## Documentation

**For AI Assistants:** Read [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for behavioral instructions, workflow requirements, and development constraints.

**Documentation Structure:** This project follows a feature-driven documentation approach. See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for:
- Complete structure overview
- Feature-driven approach guidelines
- Content ownership rules
- Documentation standards
