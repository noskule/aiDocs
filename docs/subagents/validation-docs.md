# validation-docs

Validates documentation quality across docs/ and wiki/ — the judgment half. The mechanical half (links, orphans, index consistency, bindings, template hygiene) is `docs/tools/check-docs.py`, which runs in CI on every push; do not re-check what it covers.

## Purpose

Documentation auditing that needs judgment. Run before major releases or quarterly to catch content drift a script can't see: duplicated knowledge, stale claims, misleading prose, structure violations.

## When to Invoke

- Before major releases, or quarterly
- After large documentation changes (the script gates structure; this agent judges content)
- When the user asks to validate or audit the docs

## Validation Process

### Step 1: Run the Mechanical Checks

```bash
python docs/tools/check-docs.py
```

Fix or report its errors first; carry its warnings into your report. Everything below assumes structure is sound.

### Step 2: Choose Scope

Ask user: Validate `docs/`, `wiki/`, or both?

### Step 3: Duplicate Detection

**Check for repeated content patterns:**

- Same code blocks in multiple files
- Same explanatory paragraphs
- Tables with overlapping data

**Common duplication locations:**

- 3-question test (should be in INFORMATION_MINIMALISM.md only)
- Test categories (should be in testing.md only)
- Workflow steps (should be in coding-guidelines.md only)

### Step 4: Content Staleness

For each doc, judge whether the content still matches reality:

- Claims about the code (commands, file paths, component names) — spot-check against the codebase
- `**Last Updated:**` dates far behind the file's git history suggest unreviewed drift
- Instructions that reference tools, versions, or processes no longer in use

### Step 5: Wiki Structure Check

**Verify behavior-first structure (wiki only):**

For each wiki page (except Home, README, _Sidebar):

1. Check for "## What It Does" section near top
2. Check for "## Why It Matters" section
3. Platform implementation sections present where platform content exists
4. Grep for `INTENT:` or `PLATFORM:` in headings — should not exist

### Step 6: File Length and Focus

- docs/ pages over ~200 lines, wiki pages over ~600 lines: judge whether they should split
- Pages mixing concerns that belong to different documentation levels (code / docs / wiki)

## Output Format

```markdown
## Validation Report

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Scope:** docs | wiki | both

### Mechanical (check-docs.py)
- Errors: N, Warnings: N (attach output)

### Judgment Findings
- [file]: [duplication | stale content | structure | focus] — [what and where]

### Summary
- Issues found: N
```

## Post-Validation

Ask user:

1. Fix issues now?
2. Save report to `docs/validation-report.md`?
3. Create GitHub issues for each problem?
