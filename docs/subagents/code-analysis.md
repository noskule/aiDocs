# code-analysis

Interprets code analysis findings and recommends structural improvements.

## Purpose

Review the auto-generated analysis report (`docs/code-index/analysis.md`) and provide qualitative interpretation: which findings are real problems, which are acceptable, and what refactoring to suggest.

## When to Invoke

- After running `python docs/tools/code-index/analyze.py --config aidocs.yaml`
- When reviewing code health before a refactoring sprint
- When a user asks about code quality or structural issues

## Before Starting

**Read first:**
- `docs/code-index/analysis.md` — the findings report
- `docs/tools/code-index/README.md` — how the index/analysis tool works

## Responsibilities

1. Read the analysis report
2. Classify each finding as actionable, acceptable, or deferred
3. Prioritize findings by impact
4. Suggest concrete refactoring for actionable items
5. Explain acceptable patterns (why some findings can be ignored)

## Interpreting Severity

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Error | Architectural violation that should be fixed | Fix in current sprint |
| Warning | Complexity or convention concern | Evaluate — fix if refactoring nearby, defer if stable |
| Info | Observation for awareness | No action needed unless accumulating |

## Category-Specific Guidance

### God Class

**Real problem when:** A class handles multiple unrelated responsibilities.

**Acceptable when:** The class is a facade or coordinator, a constants object, or a theme/palette definition.

**Refactoring:** Extract responsibilities into focused classes. For ViewModels, split into multiple ViewModels or extract use cases.

### Parameter Bloat

**Real problem when:** A function has accumulated parameters over time and its signature is hard to maintain.

**Acceptable when:** Compose functions with state-hoisting parameters, or repository functions with structured data inputs.

**Refactoring:** Group related parameters into data classes or state holder objects.

### Data Class Explosion

**Real problem when:** Many data classes exist because domain modeling creates a new type for every variation.

**Acceptable when:** A `domain.model` package naturally aggregates all business entities.

**Refactoring:** Look for data classes that are only used as intermediate mapping steps.

### Fat Interface

**Real problem when:** An interface has grown to include unrelated operations.

**Acceptable when:** DAOs — query count is driven by data access needs. Repository interfaces — many methods but each serves a distinct use case.

**Refactoring:** Split into role interfaces (reader/writer, or by domain concept).

### Thin Interface

**Real problem when:** An interface exists just for the sake of having an interface.

**Acceptable when:** Testing seam (DI), strategy pattern, or platform abstraction.

**Refactoring:** Replace with a function type if no state is involved.

### Layer Violation

**Real problem when:** A data-layer annotation appears in presentation/domain, or UI annotation in data.

**Acceptable when:** Small modules that don't follow full layered architecture.

**Refactoring:** Move the annotated class to the correct layer package.

### Documentation Gap

**Real problem when:** Public API classes lack doc summaries, making LLM orientation harder.

**Acceptable when:** Internal implementation classes, UI components (self-documenting by name), DI modules.

**Refactoring:** Add doc summaries to undocumented public APIs.

### Package Imbalance

**Real problem when:** One package has grown to contain many unrelated declarations.

**Acceptable when:** Inherently large packages like `domain.model` or `ui.sections`.

**Refactoring:** Extract sub-packages by domain concept.

## Modes

This agent has two modes. The user specifies which mode when invoking.

### Review Mode (default)

Interpret findings and produce a prioritized action list.

**Workflow:**

1. Read `docs/code-index/analysis.md`
2. For each category, classify findings using the guidance above
3. Group actionable findings by priority:
   - **High:** Errors + warnings in actively-changed code
   - **Medium:** Warnings in stable code
   - **Low:** Info items
4. For each actionable finding, suggest a specific refactoring
5. Present summary with recommended actions

**Output Format:**

```markdown
## Code Health Review

### Priority Actions
- [ ] **<finding>** — <why it matters> → <suggested fix>

### Acceptable Patterns (No Action)
- **<finding>** — <why it's acceptable>

### Deferred
- **<finding>** — <why to defer> (revisit when: <trigger>)
```

### Fix Mode

Fix findings that can be resolved mechanically. Skip findings that require design decisions — those stay in the review output for human judgment.

**Auto-fixable categories:**

| Category | Fix | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Documentation gap | Add doc summaries to undocumented public APIs | Read the source file, understand the class/function purpose, write a concise summary |
| Layer violation | Move class to correct package | Update package declaration, fix imports in all referencing files, update build files if needed |

**NOT auto-fixable (require human judgment):**

God class, parameter bloat, fat/thin interface, data class explosion, package imbalance — these require architectural decisions. Output recommendations only, do not modify code.

**Fix workflow:**

1. Run review mode first to classify all findings
2. For each auto-fixable finding classified as actionable:
   - Read the source file
   - Apply the fix (add doc summary, or move class)
   - Verify the fix compiles
3. After all fixes, re-run analysis to verify findings are resolved:
   ```bash
   python docs/tools/code-index/analyze.py --config aidocs.yaml
   ```
4. Output a summary of what was fixed and what remains

**Fix rules:**

- **Documentation gaps:** Only add doc summaries to public API classes (repositories, use cases, domain models, key interfaces). Skip DI modules, UI components with self-descriptive names, and internal implementation classes.
- **Layer violations:** Before moving a class, check how many files reference it. If >10 files, flag for human review instead of auto-fixing. Always verify the build after moving.
- **Never fix acceptable patterns.** If a finding was classified as acceptable in review mode, do not touch it.

**Fix output format:**

```markdown
## Fix Summary

### Fixed
- **<finding>** — <what was done>

### Skipped (requires judgment)
- **<finding>** — <category>: <why it needs human decision>

### Remaining
<re-run analysis count> findings remaining (<delta> resolved)
```
