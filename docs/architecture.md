# Architecture

## Technology Stack

**Dependencies:**

- [Language/framework versions]
- [External services/APIs]

**Why these choices:**
- [Technology A chosen over B because...]
- [Rationale for key decisions]

## System Architecture

**Core Components:**
- [Component 1] - Purpose and responsibility
- [Component 2] - Purpose and responsibility
- [Component relationships and communication]

**Module Organization:**
- [How code is organized]
- [Folder structure logic]
- [File naming conventions]

## Data Flow

**High-level pipeline:**
1. [Input] ’ [Processing] ’ [Output]
2. [Step-by-step data transformations]

**Data Structures:**
- [Key models/schemas]
- [File formats]
- [Database schemas if applicable]

## Business Rules

**Processing rules:**
- [What to process, what to skip]
- [Validation rules]
- [Edge case handling]

**Algorithms (pseudocode):**
```
[High-level algorithm descriptions]
[Not implementation details, but logic flow]
```

## Configuration

**Environment variables:**
- `VAR_NAME` - Description, default value
- [All required and optional vars]

**Config files:**
- [Structure and key settings]

## Design Decisions

**Architectural patterns:**
- [MVC, microservices, event-driven, etc.]
- [Why this pattern was chosen]

**Trade-offs:**
- [What was gained/lost with key decisions]
- [Rejected alternatives and why]

## Integration Points

**APIs:**
- [External APIs used]
- [Authentication methods]
