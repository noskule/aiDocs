## How It Works

[High-level architecture narrative - explain the main flow/process in 2-4 paragraphs]

**Example:**
> The application follows a three-stage process:
> 1. Data ingestion: Files are pulled from source repository
> 2. Processing: Content is transformed, translated, and validated
> 3. Output: Final artifacts are generated and deployed
>
> Each stage has built-in validation and error recovery to ensure reliability.
